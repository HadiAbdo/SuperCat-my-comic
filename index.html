    <h1>SuperCat (my comic) </h1>

    
    <h2>About my Comic(supercat)</h2>
    <p>Hello I am the creator of supercat(my book) I started the comic book in year 5. I started with my year 5 note book and I started on my first comic it all stated with a flute. So there's supercats owner (supercats real name is Cat) he has a flute and he plays it then cats tail started to wiggle and go up. Cat got annoyed and destroyed the flute bob(which is his name) goes back inside annoyed. Later that year I finish the book and print my first copy it for someone. I start the next comic very similar to the first book with the flute but instead of his tail it was his legs. After I finished the other book I started on the thired. I am still working on the thired book the book will be called SuperCat and friends Portel choas the reason it is called that is because in the last page of book two Bob makes a ways to control portals.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>About Bob</h2>
    <p>So about Bob, As you know Bob is Cats owner but do you now how he got Cat well it started with Bob and his mum going to the blender expatetion there were big blenders, small blenders, sharp blanders and so on. But the mage blender was what they wanted to see. They went at the mage blender Bob wanted to go inside, so he got a lader and climed in while his mum was looking at a blender he jumped in and all of a sudden the blender tured on he was jumping over the blades untill. Cat came and rescued him Cat flew in and took him out, Cat had a cape and every thing, Bob asked his mum if he could keep him, his mum agreed beacuse Cat saved bob. When Bob got older he got powers of his own and he became SuperBob he got more and more power like Cat but not as much as Cat.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>About Cat</h2>
    <p>so you now know how Bob met Cat, and now I'm going to tell you how Cat got powers, so Cat was a stary all alone with no one But Cat was allways happy he was a curious little kitten he all so had wiskers then. One day he saw a plane flying in the sky after that he allways wanted to fly he made a platform and jumped but he just fell so he made carbord wings the made him glide but then he wanted to fly more then ever. All of a sudden Cat had an idea he went to the cape store and they gave him a red cape he put it on he then went to the balloon store and they blew up balloon's and gave them to him. Cat tied on the balloons amd went to the platform. then he jumped and he flew but he didn't look a the sky it was a storm a weird lighting bolt hit him, he lost his whiskers but he could fly and control fire after this happened he got struck by lightning more times and he slowly got almost all the powers in the world.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>About the portel man</h2>
    <p>There are lots of portels in super cat that is how he meet friends and meet enemys but the person who controls all the portals is the portel man he has gave Cat new friend and new enemys but he one day had enough and tried to destroy there plant and keep SuperCat and Bob in a preson for the rest of there lifebut Cat and Bob break out and use's there time machine and saves the world leaveing the portel man angry. </p>

    <p>So Potato, Potato is a charter that was first introduced in the first book so Bob brought a random potato and dropped it accidentally and standed there talking to Cat the potato started to grow and grow, untill it was a alive potato that had arms and legs Cat was hungry and took bite. Potato died later Potato turned into a zombie Potato Cat got scared and shot a fire ball it made the zombie fire Potato Cat used his revive power, Potato came back to life and said "You ate me" Cat said sorry and Potato forgave him and flew away.(ok this part is not in a book yet) later Potato found a rock the rock gave him a little portel powers and he now had a army he use the army fought the evil big bacon and king egg and they won, Potato got a few more powers after that.</p>
